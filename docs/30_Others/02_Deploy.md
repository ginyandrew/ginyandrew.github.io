## What is Docker ? Why we use it?
To use Program A (compatible with Oracle 9/ linux) and B (compatible with Oracle 10g/ Windows) and C (.. 11g) at the same time... multiple servers ? or **Docker** ?

A Docker container is an open source software development platform.
while VM virtualizes an operating system (heavy), Docker runs processes in a container (light&fast), a user space of the operating system. **(piece of operating system)**

## What is Docker image ?
Docker image includes the files and configs required for the container. it has immutable properties.
